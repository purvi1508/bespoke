"""Deck class that presents cards and tracks ratings.

Card choice notes:
- The modes for a new card are introduced in the order they were passed in.
- Cards you know on the first attempt have special treatment, they get paused.
- Different mode, any score, is treated as blue.
- Blue (0): Makes a following green act like a blue for some time.
- Yellow (2): Treated like red
- Green (3): Knowledge level is the longest interval not interrupted by red.
- Red (1): Stops and shortens green intervals, high urgency if last.
