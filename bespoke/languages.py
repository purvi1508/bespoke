"""Supported languages and related data.

To support your native language to translate into, add a Language config file
to the `DATA_DIR` directory.

If you want to be able to learn the language, additionally navigate to
-> `DATA_DIR` -> `language.code_name`
and add the files:

- `vocabulary_{difficulty}.txt` for all difficulties with vocabulary.
- `grammar_{difficulty}.txt` with grammar concepts in the language.

The txt files have one entry per line. You need at least the files for A1.
